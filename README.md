# Internet Radio

Here we describe the design, construction, programming and operation of an internet radio with a minimal one button interface based on a Raspberry Pi.

There are 7 available radio stations. One scrolls through them by successively pressing the tactile switch. The station number selected is diplayed in binary by three red 5mm LEDs. When all three LEDs are off then no station is playing (number 0). When the radio is powered off (by removing power to the Raspberry Pi) the currently streaming station is saved so that when the radio is powered on later that station resumes streaming.

## Physical design

The TinyCad design file [WifiRadio2.dsn](Hardware/WifiRadio2.dsn) for the interface circuitry is displayed below:
![WifiRadio2.net](Images/WifiRadio2_dsn.png)

The resulting VeeCad file [WifiRadio2.per](Hardware/WifiRadio2.per) is displayed below:

It is obtained from the Netlist file [WifiRadio2.net](Hardware/WifiRadio2.net) generated from WifiRadio2.dsn (displayed above).

This is what the completed interface board looks like:

Note that the LEDs are offset from the circuit board by 5mm using an appropriate piece of balsawood.

## Enclosure

The interface circuit is placed in a custom 3D printed enclosure which is secured on top of the case that houses the Raspberry Pi. 5 wires connect the interface circuit to the Raspberry Pi. This is the internet radio to which stereo USB powered 3.5m audio speakers must be attached (to the underlying Raspberry Pi).

The case was designed using Blender.

The top of the case is in [WifiRadio2_BoxTop.blend](Hardware/WifiRadio2_BoxTop.blend), while the bottom is in [WifiRadio2_BoxBottom.blend](Hardware/WifiRadio2_BoxBottom.blend). To view or edit these files open them with the Blender 4.3 App in Windows 11.

To be able to 3D print the enclosure these files must be exported from the Blender App as [WifiRadio2_BoxTop.stl](Hardware/WifiRadio2_BoxTop.stl) and [WifiRadio2_BoxBottom.stl](Hardware/WifiRadio2_BoxBottom.stl) respectively.

Finally these *.stl files must be opened into the Crealty Print 6.0 Windows 11 App which creates the [WifiRadio2_BoxTop.3mf](Hardware/WifiRadio2_BoxTop.3mf) and [WifiRadio2_BoxBottom.3mf](Hardware/WifiRadio2_BoxBottom.3mfl) respectively. These contain the type of printer needed and other details of the print and are the basis for creating (by File => Export => Export Gcode...) the *.gcode files [WifiRadio2_BoxTop.gcode](Hardware/WifiRadio2_BoxTop.gcode) and [WifiRadio2_BoxBottom.gcode](Hardware/WifiRadio2_BoxBottom.gcode) respectively. These are the actual files used by the 3D Printer to do the actual printing! The files saved here are for the Crealty Ender-3 V3 SE printer with default setting for Hyper PLA.

If you have a different 3D printer you can still use the *.stl files but you will have to generate the *.gcode files yourself.

## Raspberry Pi setup

I have used a Raspberry Pi Model B Rev1.2 with 4Gb RAM, running Raspbian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) on a 32Gb SD card (which you will have to image).
It is configured to Boot To Desktop with Auto login, with only the Remote GPIO enabled.

Install Python3 and idle3 as well as vlc, all of which reside in the directory /usr/bin/.
In the directory /home/{username}/.config/autostart/ create a file autovlc.desktop with the contents:

```terminal
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=/usr/bin/idle -r /home/roman/GitHub/WifiRadio2/Radio5.py
```

This way of running the script via autostart in the GUI is because I tried to run it after boot in the Command Line Interface (CLI), however I could not make this work due to some privilage issues which made vlc unable to execute. This would have been more efficient and elegant but I just wanted to make it work.

In the directory /home/{username}/GitHub/WifiRadio2/ which you need to create place the python script Radio5.py (detailed below). You will also need to make the Wifi network automatically connect to an available access point by discovering it and inputting its password. if you move the location of this internet radio you will need to setup another wifi connection by accessing the Raspbewrry Pi's GUI with an attached mouse, keyboard and screen! 

## Software

The radio is implemented in software by a python script [Radio5.py](Radio5.py) that auto starts through the Python IDLE shell when the the GUI becomes active. The audio streaming uses cvlc. A valid wifi connection is assumed to be available and automatically enabled when the Raspberry Pi is powered on.

```python
# all part of the Python standard libraries, with RPI.GPIO pre installed as part of the Raspian os
import subprocess
import time
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import os;    

# Get the directory where the script is located
script_directory = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))

# Create the full filepath to the saved radio station file
filename = 'savedRadioStation.txt'
filepath = os.path.join(script_directory, filename)
print(f'The file {filepath} stores the last streamed station number.')

# Use BCM GPIO numbering 
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Define the 4 Raspberry Pi pins that go to the interface circuit board
# Ground is not included
button_pin = 26
led0_pin = 19
led1_pin = 13
led2_pin = 6

# Setup the pins
GPIO.setup(button_pin, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_UP)
GPIO.setwarnings(False)
GPIO.setup(led0_pin, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(led1_pin, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(led2_pin, GPIO.OUT)

# setup the leds to be initially all off
GPIO.output(led0_pin,GPIO.LOW)
GPIO.output(led1_pin,GPIO.LOW)
GPIO.output(led2_pin,GPIO.LOW)

# 2D array of radio station information in [short name, long name, url] format
# clearly this can be varied if you wish to listen to different 7 stations

## List of parts

Pricing and availability as of 26-Jan-2025. Total cost is $250.57, but clearly some of the items will be usable in many other projects or you will already have them. The pro rata cost is __$209.11__

You will also need a soldering iron and solder, some two sided tape for attaching the circuit enclosure on top of the Raspberry Pi case as well as a printer to print the station legend for taping/sticking to the top of the enclosure.
